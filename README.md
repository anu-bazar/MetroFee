# MetroFee

Welcome to my Metro Fee calculator - written in JS, styled frontend interface with HTML/CSS! ðŸ˜Š

This project was inspired by the not-so-fair metro fee pay increase and was modeled off of M4, my favorite metro line. ðŸ˜‚

This project:
+ Uses boolean values and if..else statements to branch logic of your program
+ Uses a data structure like an array to store values
+ Uses a loop or a while loop to reduce repetition
+ Uses functions to make code reusable
+ Uses console.log and alert appropriately to display messages
+ Uses some HTML and CSS to create a basic website. Use at least 4 different HTML tags
and style at least 2 of them. 
+ Gets input from the user on a web page
+ Makes changes to the HTML or CSS using JavaScript
+ Uses an event to trigger a change to a web page.
